# Data Preparation for Entity Resolution

*by Sasan Bahadaran*

## Introduction

### Data Preparation and Data Science

Data preparation refers to the act of manipulating ones data to transform it into a suitable form for further analysis and processing.  This process involves many different tasks and requires understanding of what manipulations are necessary for a particular dataset, as well as what the goal is in terms of how you plan to process the data further.  Some of the tasks that can be part of a data preparation for a particular project include data cleaning, normalization, and imputation.  Data preparation is a part of many data related projects, but specifically in terms of Data Science, it is said that data preparation accounts for about 60% of the time spent on a project.  Considering the percentage of time spent on this task, you can conclude that is the most crucial part of the Data Science process.  Without proper data preparation, you cannot expect that the results of your analysis will provide undesired results.  The principal of "garbage in, garbage out" is very applicable in this context.  In this blog we will be discussing the basics of data preparation, some techniques that can be applied using a sample dataset, and a comparison of performing Entity Resolution with and without performing proper data preparation.

### Entity Resolution

Entity resolution (ER) is the task of disambiguating records that correspond to real world entities across and within datasets. The applications of entity resolution are tremendous, particularly for public sector and federal datasets related to health, transportation, finance, law enforcement, and antiterrorism.

Unfortunately, the problems associated with entity resolution are equally big — as the volume and velocity of data grow, inference across networks and semantic relationships between entities becomes more and more difficult. Data quality issues, schema variations, and idiosyncratic data collection traditions can all complicate these problems even further. When combined, such challenges amount to a substantial barrier to organizations’ ability to fully understand their data, let alone make effective use of predictive analytics to optimize targeting, thresholding, and resource management.

Some of the tasks involved with Entity Resolution include:
- Deduplication
- Record Linkage
- Canonicalization

In this blog, our focus will be specifically on record linkage and canonicalization of data.

### Dedupe

[Dedupe](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dedupe/1.4.3) is a library that uses machine learning to perform deduplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data.  There are other tools available for Entity Resolution as well but we will be focusing on using this particular tool.

## Methods of Data Preparation

### Data Normalization

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form#Computing), the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called data normalization.  In the context of Entity Resolution, this is the process of disambiguating or standardizing the data, which will help improve matching.  Below are some examples of normalization techniques:

* Convert to all lower case
* remove whitespace
* remove spelling errors
* Standardize abbreviations
* Remove punctuation

Some of the techniques mentioned above, such as standardizing abbreviations and removing spelling errors may seem like common sense when it comes to cleaning up your data in preparation for entity resolution, but how do some of the other aforementioned techniques such as removing whitespace help?  Some metrics that can be used for entity resolution are affected by whitespace, such as Levenshtein (or edit distance).  Levenshtein distance calculates the minimum number of edits necessary to change a word into another word.  Lets look at an example of whitespace can affect this score.

Using the levenshtein function that is part of the fuzzystrmatch module in Postgres we can run the following query comparing two words - "GUMBO" and "GAMBOL":
```
test=# select levenshtein ('GUMBO', 'GAMBOL'); 
-------------
           2
(1 row) 
```

The number of edits necessary to change "GUMBO" to "GAMBOL" is 2.  What happens if one of the words has a space in it in the database?

```
test=# select levenshtein ('GUMBO', ' GAMBOL ');
 levenshtein 
-------------
           4
(1 row)
```

In this example "GAMBOL" has been changed to " GAMBOL ".  The spaces on the left and right side mean that the edit score has increased.  Let's try another example:

```
test=# select levenshtein ('GUMBO', 'GA MBOL');
 levenshtein 
-------------
           3
(1 row)
```

### Schema Normalization -

Examples include:
* Match attribute names (title -> name)
* Split compound attributes (full name -> first, last)
* Segment records from raw text



## Tools for Data Preparation

As far as how to implement your strategy for data preparation there are many different methods.  Below are some various tools you can use:

* [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) - This is a free, open source tool that used to be owned by Google with many methods for workkng with messy data.

* Database scripts - Whether your data resides in a database or not, one way of preparing your data for entity resolution is to apply your prepping techniques using some SQL scripts.

* Scripts using various languages (e.g., Python, R) and libraries for cleaning data (e.g., Pandas) - Using langauges such as Python and R, you can create scripts that will apply your preparation techniques to the data.  There are many libraries available for these tasks for various languages such as [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for Python.

* Excel - Being that many people use Excel, I thought it is worth mentioning that you can clean up your data using techniques in Excel as well.

## Our Sample Dataset

The sample dataset I will be using in this post comes from [OSHA](https://www.osha.gov) (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and can be obtained from the Department of Labor [Data Enforcement website](http://enforcedata.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php).  It is a CSV file containing records of safety inspections performed by OSHA inspectors at various times.  When inspectors are conducting these safety inspections, they are manually entering all information, which leads to many errors and inconsistencies.  Some of the issues with this dataset include:
- no unique identifier for business
- non-standardized entry of business names
- Random punctuation
- Spelling errors
- Errors with addresses

**include table with a few examples of the issues with the data.

## Testing the Effect of Data Preparation on Canonicalization of Entities

In order to show how task of data preparation can help improve the matches that you get while performing entity resolution, we are going to perform a test using our sample dataset above and the Dedupe library.

First, we will run our sample dataset through Dedupe without any data preparation.

*provide setup for postgres and load data file?

Do active learning

Do clustering

Show results

Next, we will run our sample dataset through Dedupe again.  This time though, we will perform some data preparation to clean up the data a bit.

Perform data prep on file

Do active learning

Do clustering

Show results

How can we visualize these results?
